### Creating New Posts

To create a new blog post, follow these steps:

1.  Create a new file in the `_posts` directory.
2.  The filename must follow this format: `YYYY-MM-DD-your-post-title.md`.

    ```

4.  Write your blog post content using Markdown syntax.

### Using Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Here are some of the most common Markdown syntax elements:

-   **Headings**: Use `#` to create headings. The number of `#` symbols determines the heading level.
-   **Lists**: Use `*` or `-` for bulleted lists, and numbers for ordered lists.
-   **Emphasis**: Use `*` or `_` for italics and `**` or `__` for bold.
-   **Links**: Use `[link text](URL)` to create a hyperlink.
-   **Images**: Use `![alt text](image-URL)` to embed an image.
